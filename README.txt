VIP Nail Spa
=============

This website was created by Sarah-Kate Ryan and Lizzie LaFont. We chose to create a website for VIP Nail Spa because they did not previously have a website, and one of the best ways to spread word throughout a community in today's society is through the Internet. The owner of VIP Nail Spa, Tracy Do, and her daughter, Tran Phan, helped us along the way by supplying us with information and photos to use on their site.

===========
The Website
===========

-Our business did not have standard company colors, so we chose to use colors that reminded us of nails. Throughout our whole website, we used a color scheme consisting of black, white, pinks, and reds.

-For the body of each webpage, we used a simple and easy to read font, but for the banner, we used a more unique and fun font for the name of the business. 

-VIP Nail Spa did not have a logo, so for our favicon, we created a simple black and white nail polish bottle and brush. 

-The navigation is conveniently fixed to the top of the page. 

-The footer contains all of the basic information someone would want to know, like the address, phone number, hours, and social media accounts, along with a second navigation and a nifty back to top button.

-Our website is fully responsive to every screen size.

=========
Home Page
=========

-The webpage begins with a brief welcome and description of the company and what it is all about.

-We included featured images of previous nail designs to grab the user's attention and give them examples of work done for previous clients.

-Working hours and contact information are given with links to your device's chosen app for phone calls and also social media pages. 

==========
About Page
==========

-The about page includes a history of the company and a brief biography of the owner, Tracy Do.

-Included are images of the staff of VIP Nail Spa hard at work.

=============
Services Page
=============

-The services page includes all of VIP Nail Spa's offered nail and spa treatments with their prices. The page also includes additional information a client may find interesting, like the complimentary beverages and polish brands. 

-The three-column layout allows for more information to be viewed on one screen which minimizes scrolling for users.

============
Gallery Page
============

-The gallery page is a collection of previous nail designs done by the staff to give potential clients an idea of the quality of work and skill by VIP Nail Spa and inspire their future nail treatments.

-The light pink borders allow for the images to stand out.

-Hover over each individual picture for an enlarged image on PCs. (We couldn't figure out why, but the pictures won't hover on a Mac.) 

============
Contact Page
============

-Our contact page includes all of the contact information of the company in a list with corresponding icons. Both the icons and contact information are linked.

-We also included a map for easily accessible directions. (For some reason, Google has added an "&" between the words 'Nail' and 'Spa')

=================
Testimonials Page
=================

-Our testimonials page is set up in a two-column layout for easy readability. 

-We included the names with the comments, along with a link to the original review and the star ratings to give clients other people's reviews and opinions.

-Our testimonials were taken from Google, Facebook, and Yellow Pages.

-Sorry about the grammar issues in the comments, but we didn't want to change other people's words! (Except for some that were really bad mistakes) :)


THANK YOU!!!! :)
